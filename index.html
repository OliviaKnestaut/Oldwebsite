                    <p class="excerpt">"There is a lighthouse on the coast,<br>Watched over by a horrible host. <br> Rocks jut out from the lighthouse’s base, <br>Encasing a crashed boat held firmly in place. <br>Vines inch up its fading striped walls <br>And mice scurry down its crumbling halls. <br>But alas, the thing that matters most, <br>A working light shining over the coast. <br>This lighthouse has long been in disrepair, <br>But its structure is not what you need to beware. <br>Passing the coast is safe in the day, <br>For you have the sun and it will show you the way <br>But even with the houses’ blinding light, <br>No ship has ever made it at night..."</p>

                    <p class="excerpt">"We were standing before it, a terrifying skeleton reaching up towards the sky. Wildwood’s “The Great Nor’Easter” Roller Coaster. At 13, I had never been on a roller coaster. From the time I was very young, my family thought negatively of them, they did not enjoy roller coasters. We never went to amusement parks and I had probably only seen three or four coasters in my life. Because these negative thoughts surrounded me from such a young age, I grew up with a hatred for them, with no reason of my own. I turned down field trips, I turned down friends, all because of a decision that was made for me. Then came the summer of 2017..."</p>
